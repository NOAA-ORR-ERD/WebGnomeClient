Location Files
##############

Location Files were created to guide users through the model setup for a
specific region. Each Location File contains pre-packaged
information about the tides, currents, and shorelines in the region it covers.
WebGNOME uses the Location File information and user input to set up the model.

Location Files are useful for planning but should not be used to model real oil spills!
The Location Files are based on climatological or "average" conditions for a specific
region. Environmental conditions during an actual spill may differ widely from typical
conditions. A useful analogy is an almanac versus a weather forecast -- if you are trying to
pick a good month to schedule a picnic an almanac may provide guidance. However, if you
have a picnic planned for tomorrow, an up to date weather forecast which incorporates recent
observations will provide more useful information. Similarly, the Location Files are a
valuable resource for planning for a potential future spill but need to be modified to
incorporate actual real-time environmental conditions in the case a spill occurs.

Location File Wizard
====================

To get started using WebGNOME Location Files, visit:
http://gnome-stage.orr.noaa.gov/#locations

The Location File Wizard will guide you through setting up a scenario with a
series of questions. The exact questions depend on the specific region being modeled but may include
questions about: wind conditions, river flow rates, circulation patterns, and the
type of spill to be modeled.
If you need help answering a Wizard question, a Location File Help button is available
on the Wizard title bar.

The Location File Help topics and User Guides also provide some sources of real-time and historical data
about the region and more technical information about the Location File development.
