About Glacier Bay, Alaska
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Glacier Bay is a recently (300 years ago) deglaciated fjord located along the northern end of the Alaska panhandle (about 50 miles [80 km] west of Juneau) in southeast Alaska. The Y-shaped bay is approximately 65 miles [105 km] long and has several finger-like inlets extending from it. Two of the inlets, Muir and Tarr, extend to within miles of British Columbia, Canada. To the east and west of the bay are the steep mountain summits of the Chilkat and Fairweather ranges. Glacier Bay offers spectacular scenery and is one of the most popular destinations for cruise ships visiting Alaska.

Glacier Bay is an oceanographically and biologically complex area in a small package. Large amounts of freshwater runoff from calving glaciers and rain, combined with large tidal exchange in the estuary, can make Glacier Bay change dramatically over a few hours. The glaciers of this area produce large amounts of sediment, which can drastically change the water clarity. Much of the sediment collects within the bay; in some places, more than one centimeter [0.4 inches] is laid down each day.

Background
==========================

As a recently deglaciated fjord, tides and freshwater outflow dominate the currents in Glacier Bay. The seasonal cycle of freshwater outflow is accounted for in the tidal coefficients, although on any day the actual runoff could be quite different. Without real-time monitoring of freshwater flows from glaciers or rain, climatology was the only option to use in the Glacier Bay Location File.


Current Patterns
==================================

The tidal current pattern was simulated in the NOAA Circulation Analysis for Trajectory Simulations (CATS) hydrodynamic model using the WAC submodel with shallow water wave dynamics. The tidal time dependence is simulated using the tidal coefficients from the tidal station west of Beardslee Island (58° 28' N, 136° 02' W).
