Getting Started
###############

There are multiple ways to get started using WebGNOME. For example, various
"wizards" are available that guide users through setting up a scenario. In this 
case, users will be prompted to answer a sequence of questions. Users can 
also choose a Custom Setup and load and enter all input data manually.

More information on the different ways to use WebGNOME is found in 
subsequent sections.

The Menu Bar
------------

No matter which way users begin setting up the model the Menu Bar will be 
visible at the top of the page. Use the Menu Bar to create a New model scenario, to Save
an existing model scenario, and to access Help Pages.

Once the model scenario is setup, the output can be Run as a spill animation or exported in 
various formats. This option is also available from the menu bar.

Switching between Model Views
-----------------------------
The WebGNOME application also has various "Views" for setting up and viewing the spill scenario.
To switch between Views in the model, the icons
pictured below are always found on the top right of the Menu Bar.

 - To make modifications to the model setup, switch to Setup View.
 - To view the oil budget, switch to Fate View.
 - To view the oil trajectory, switch to Map View.

Getting Help

For detailed help information when entering information in forms or interacting with the various "Views", look for the help icon (:fa:`question-circle`) on the upper right of the form or View. This will give information specific to the individual form or View.
